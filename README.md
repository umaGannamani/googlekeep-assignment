I built a desktop web application for keeping notes. It can draw inspiration from Google Keep. Here are the features that built:
Menu Features contains
- Create a new note
- Search in your notes
- Special view - Label View [all tagged notes with that label]
- One note can have multiple tags [up to 9 tags]
  It contains toggle between background colors for the note
